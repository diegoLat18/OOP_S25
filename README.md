# OOP_S25

Welcome to my project portfolio for **OOP_S25** â€“ a Java programming course focused on object-oriented principles, practical coding skills, and advanced Java topics. Over the course of 12 weeks, I completed hands-on labs and challenging projects to build and demonstrate my understanding of Java syntax, problem-solving, class design, and application development.
