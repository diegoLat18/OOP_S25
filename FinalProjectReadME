# ðŸ“š Student Course Organizer

This is my final project for my OOP25 class. It is a student organizer app so each student can add their classes and manage the different aspects of them.
## ðŸŽ¯ Features

- Add multiple college courses to organize your semester.
- For each course:
  - Add assignments/projects.
  - Add important academic dates.
  - Use checkboxes to mark tasks as completed.
- Tasks marked as completed are automatically removed when you close the course window.
- View assignment and date counts directly from the main screen.
- Clean and responsive interface designed with IntelliJ's GUI Designer.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Demonstrated

- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming:
  - Encapsulation (`Course`, `Task`, `Homework`, `ImportantDate`)
  - Inheritance (`Homework` and `ImportantDate` extend `Task`)
- âœ… Use of lists (`ArrayList`, `JList`, `DefaultListModel`)
- âœ… Event handling (`ActionListener`, `MouseListener`)
- âœ… Custom rendering (`CheckboxRenderer` for checkboxes in JList)
- âœ… Method decomposition and clean modular code
- âœ… GUI development with Swing

## ðŸ“¦ Structure

- `Main.java` â€“ Launches the app
- `OrganizerForm.java` â€“ First screen UI and logic (course list)
- `CourseDetailsForm.java` â€“ Second screen UI for managing individual course content
- `Task.java` â€“ Abstract class for reusable assignment/date structure
- `Homework.java`, `ImportantDate.java` â€“ Inherited task types
- `ChecklistItem.java` â€“ Model for checkbox items in lists
- `CheckboxRenderer.java` â€“ Renderer for showing checkboxes inside JLists

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Make sure you're using a JDK (e.g., Java 17 or later)
3. Run the `Main` class
4. Start adding your courses and organizing your tasks!
